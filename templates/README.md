FitSplit: Customized Workout Plan Generator

FitSplit is a web application designed to create personalized gym workout plans based on user input. This documentation serves as a user manual, detailing the setup, configuration, and use of the project. 

The application begins with a welcoming homepage which includes a "Start" button. Clicking this button directs users to the "Select Your Gym Experience Level" page, where they can choose their experience level from three options: "Beginner", "Intermediate", or "Advanced". These levels provide the foundation for tailoring the workout plans, ensuring that each user receives a program suited to their current fitness background.

After selecting an experience level, users are taken to the "Select Number of Workout Days" page. This page allows users to specify how many days per week they plan to work out, with options ranging from 1 to 7. Based on these inputs, the program generates one of 21 potential workout combinations, ensuring a highly personalized fitness plan for every user.

The generated workout plan includes detailed dropdown instructions for each day in the gym. These dropdowns provide names for every exercise, ensuring users know exactly what to do on each workout day. Additionally, each plan comes with an embedded YouTube tutorial featuring demonstrations of all exercises in the order they appear in the plan. This ensures that users can confidently execute each workout, regardless of experience level.
